FDEF Signal Analyzer - Production-Ready Automotive Signal Dependency Analysis

This software is designed for analyzing Function Design and Engineering Flow
(FDEF) documents in the automotive industry. It combines advanced computer
vision, mathematical parsing, and domain-specific pattern matching to extract
signal dependencies from PDF documents.

Key Features:
- Advanced PDF processing with OCR optimization
- Computer vision arrow and block detection
- Mathematical equation parsing with SymPy
- Automotive template matching (A2L, AUTOSAR, CAN/LIN)
- Interactive dependency graph visualization
- Comprehensive confidence scoring and validation

Dependencies and Attributions:
- OpenCV (Apache 2.0 License) - Computer vision operations
- SymPy (BSD License) - Symbolic mathematics
- NetworkX (BSD License) - Graph algorithms and analysis
- Tesseract OCR (Apache 2.0 License) - Text recognition
- Plotly (MIT License) - Interactive visualizations
- pdf2image (MIT License) - PDF to image conversion
- NumPy (BSD License) - Numerical computing
- FuzzyWuzzy (GPL License) - Fuzzy string matching

System Requirements:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Tesseract OCR system installation
- Poppler utilities for PDF processing
- Sufficient RAM for image processing (recommended: 4GB+)
